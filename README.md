# 🧪 Logistic Regression – Breast Cancer Classification

This repository contains my work for **Task 4**, where I implemented a binary classifier using **Logistic Regression** on the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset**.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Classify tumors as malignant or benign.
- Understand and evaluate a logistic regression model.
- Explore sigmoid function and ROC-AUC.

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

---

## ✅ Steps Performed

1. **Loaded** the breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets`.
2. **Preprocessed** data using train-test split and feature standardization.
3. **Trained** a logistic regression model on the training data.
4. **Predicted** and evaluated using:
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Precision, Recall, F1-Score
   - ROC-AUC Curve
5. **Visualized** the ROC curve and sigmoid function.

## 📊 Key Results

- Achieved high accuracy and ROC-AUC on test set.
- The sigmoid function was visualized to show how outputs are mapped to probabilities.
- The confusion matrix showed correct classification of most cases.

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- The difference between linear and logistic regression.
- How the sigmoid function converts linear output into probabilities.
- The importance of ROC-AUC in binary classification.
- How precision and recall help evaluate class-wise performance.
